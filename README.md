# FPlanner

This is my pet project to calculate my finances for my future based on my salary and credits, incomes and expences.

## What is this repository?

**FPlanner** is open source product. I used T3 stack - tailwind, typescript, tRPC.

## How to use the actual product? 

Click to the [project link](https://fplanner.vercel.app/). I used Clerk for simple authentication, drizzle for ORM and Postgres for DB and Vercel to deploy. Your data will be stored, so you can check your plans any time. 

1. Authenticate 
2. Click the "Add money flow" button and fill the form.
3. Observe graph and table changes.
